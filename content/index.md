  Water
chapterOneMessage: |
  Solar Chapter will collaborate with PAMSIMAS (A National Platform for Rural Water Supply and Sanitation) to provide easier access for clean water.
  Our plan is to build a reservoir to collect water from three water sources, which will then deliver the water to the distribution tank near the village by using solar pumps.
  From the distribution tank, the water will be distributed to 16 locations across the village.

  Education
chapterTwoMessage: |
  The Solar Chapter Michigan team will work on creating a more conducive learning environment for the children of Desa Umutnana and Desa As Manulea in SDN As Manulea.
  Our main goal is to improve the library to get kids more excited about being in school and also giving them access to learning materials out of class.
  We believe that early childhood literacy is important because the earlier a person has access to information, the more efficient that access will be.
  This is why, we hope that this library will be a vital tool in improving the literacy skills of the future generation.

  Kain Makna
chapterThreeMessage: |
  Our initiative, MAKNA (/mak·na/), means purpose.
  This initiative is inspired by the Umutnana's women tenun community. Consisting of 20 village women, their work is to weave and produce tenun products.
  They used to have a ‘tenun-house’ that was rebuilt to become a health clinic (Puskesmas) due to not able to sell their products to a market or a distributor.
  These products are only available to sell whenever visitors come from the neighboring city of Kupang or given as gifts to government officials.
